# Horiseon Project

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to help Horiseon better display their website, enhance it's accessibility, and create a more stream-lined code for future developers to utilize. My efforts have solved redundant coding, missing functions, and lacking semantic labeling. I learned how to merge selectors to reduce repetitive coding in the CSS file. My project should stand out as efficient and easy to follow. I did this by organizing the files and commenting the sections, along with the changes I made.

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and list them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
