# Horiseon Project

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to help Horiseon better display their website, enhance it's accessibility, and create a more stream-lined code for future developers to utilize. My efforts have solved redundant coding, missing functions, and lacking semantic labeling. I learned how to merge selectors to reduce repetitive coding in the CSS file. My project should stand out as efficient and easy to follow. I did this by organizing the files and commenting the sections, along with the changes I made.
